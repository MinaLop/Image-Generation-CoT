## Overview
Welcome to the Image-Generation-CoT repository! This project focuses on investigating the concept of Counterfactual Thinking (CoT) in autoregressive image generation. With recent advancements in artificial intelligence and neural networks, generative models have become increasingly popular for creating new and realistic images. Understanding how CoT reasoning can enhance the quality and diversity of generated images is a fascinating area of research that this repository aims to explore.

In this repository, you will find code implementations, research papers, and experimental results related to the integration of CoT reasoning into autoregressive image generation models. We believe that by incorporating CoT principles into the generation process, we can achieve more diverse, creative, and contextually relevant image outputs.

Our goal is to push the boundaries of image generation by leveraging psychological insights from CoT theory. Through innovative experiments and cutting-edge algorithms, we are paving the way for exciting developments in the field of generative AI.

## Usage
To run the image generation experiments using CoT reasoning, follow these instructions:

1. Preprocess the dataset:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py --dataset dataset_name
   ```

2. Train the CoT-enhanced image generation model:
   ```bash
